# Orbitals

## What's the point?

Many visualizations of the atom can be found. Most of the time, the nucleus and electron are depicted as little balls. The electrons orbit the nucleus.

The fact, that electrons in the atom are standing waves is mostly ignored in the visualizations and when the wavefunction is displayed it is mainly a surface that contains a certain percentage of the electron.

3D-Visualizations of a (soft) electron wave function are rare and they are never interactive.
I will change that.

... about to come.
