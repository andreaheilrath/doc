  abstract = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42{$\pm$}3 {$\mu$}as, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M=(6.5{$\pm$}0.7)\texttimes 109 Me. Our radiowave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},

  abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has mapped the central compact radio source of the elliptical galaxy M87 at 1.3 mm with unprecedented angular resolution. Here we consider the physical implications of the asymmetric ring seen in the 2017 EHT data. To this end, we construct a large library of models based on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and synthetic images produced by general relativistic ray tracing. We compare the observed visibilities with this library and confirm that the asymmetric ring is consistent with earlier predictions of strong gravitational lensing of synchrotron emission from a hot plasma orbiting near the black hole event horizon. The ring radius and ring asymmetry depend on black hole mass and spin, respectively, and both are therefore expected to be stable when observed in future EHT campaigns. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. If the black hole spin and M87's large scale jet are aligned, then the black hole spin vector is pointed away from Earth. Models in our library of non-spinning black holes are inconsistent with the observations as they do not produce sufficiently powerful jets. At the same time, in those models that produce a sufficiently powerful jet, the latter is powered by extraction of black hole spin energy through mechanisms akin to the Blandford-Znajek process. We briefly consider alternatives to a black hole for the central compact object. Analysis of existing EHT polarization data and data taken simultaneously at other wavelengths will soon enable new tests of the GRMHD models, as will future EHT campaigns at 230 and 345 GHz.},

  abstract = {Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations at 230 GHz have now imaged polarized emission around the supermassive black hole in M87 on event-horizon scales. This polarized synchrotron radiation probes the structure of magnetic fields and the plasma properties near the black hole. Here we compare the resolved polarization structure observed by the EHT, along with simultaneous unresolved observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, to expectations from theoretical models. The low fractional linear polarization in the resolved image suggests that the polarization is scrambled on scales smaller than the EHT beam, which we attribute to Faraday rotation internal to the emission region. We estimate the average density ne {$\sim$} 104\textendash 7 cm-3, magnetic field strength B {$\sim$} 1\textendash 30 G, and electron temperature Te {$\sim$} (1\textendash 12) \texttimes{} 1010 K of the radiating plasma in a simple one-zone emission model. We show that the net azimuthal linear polarization pattern may result from organized, poloidal magnetic fields in the emission region. In a quantitative comparison with a large library of simulated polarimetric images from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we identify a subset of physical models that can explain critical features of the polarimetric EHT observations while producing a relativistic jet of sufficient power. The consistent GRMHD models are all of magnetically arrested accretion disks, where near-horizon magnetic fields are dynamically important. We use the models to infer a mass accretion rate onto the black hole in M87 of (3\textendash 20) \texttimes{} 10-4 Me yr-1.},

  abstract = {In social-ecological systems (SES), where social and ecological processes are intertwined, phenomena are usually complex and involve multiple interdependent causes. Figuring out causal relationships is thus challenging but needed to better understand and then affect or manage such systems. One important and widely used tool to identify and communicate causal relationships is visualization. Here, we present several common visualization types: diagrams of objects and arrows, X-Y plots, and X-Y-Z plots, and discuss them in view of the particular challenges of visualizing causation in complex systems such as SES. We use a simple demonstration model to create and compare exemplary visualizations and add more elaborate examples from the literature. This highlights implicit strengths and limitations of widely used visualization types and facilitates adequate choices when visualizing causation in SES. Thereupon, we recommend further suitable ways to account for complex causation, such as figures with multiple panels, or merging different visualization types in one figure. This provides caveats against oversimplifications. Yet, any single figure can rarely capture all relevant causal relationships in an SES. We therefore need to focus on specific questions, phenomena, or subsystems, and often also on specific causes and effects that shall be visualized. Our recommendations allow for selecting and combining visualizations such that they complement each other, support comprehensive understanding, and do justice to the existing complexity in SES. This lets visualizations realize their potential and play an important role in identifying and communicating causation.},

At the heart of the claims about the emerging contributions of functional brain mapping is a paradox: functional imagers seem to reject representations while also using them at multiple points in their work. This article therefore considers a love-hate relationship between scientists and their object: the case of the iconoclastic imager. This paradoxical stance is the result of the formation of an interdisciplinary approach that brings together a number of scientific traditions and their particular standards of what constitutes scientific evidence. By examining the various ways in which images are deployed and rejected, the origins of these conflicting tendencies can be traced to the technological, methodological, and institutional elements in the work of functional imagers. This approach provides insight into the current demarcation of imaging and reflects on features of visual knowledge.},

It specifically focuses on training related to five goals, including views about training to make science messages understandable, as well as attitude-focused training meant to build trust and credibility, to demonstrate that one listens to the public, to demonstrate that one cares about the public's views, and to frame messages to resonate with audiences' pre-existing values. The theory of planned behavior and procedural justice theory were used to identify potential predictors of views about training toward these goals. Results show that the scientists rate message comprehension and credibility most favorably and give their lowest rating to training related to framing. Regression analyses reveal that believing that public engagement can make a difference (external efficacy) and belief in the ethicality of specific goals were the best predictors of whether scientists saw value in goal-oriented training. The results suggest that communication trainers might benefit from emphasizing the effectiveness and ethicality of engagement activities if they want to attract scientists to communication training, and that more work may need to be done by professional organizations to help scientists consider the value of thinking about communication goals beyond the traditional focus on message comprehension. \# 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recording snapshots of individual molecules with ultrashort exposure times is a key ingredient towards this goal, as atoms move on femtosecond (10               -15               \,s) timescales. For condensed-phase samples, ultrafast, atomically resolved structure determination has been demonstrated using X-ray and electron diffraction. Pioneering experiments have also started addressing gaseous samples. However, they face the problem of low target densities, low scattering cross sections and random spatial orientation of the molecules. Therefore, obtaining images of entire, isolated molecules capturing all constituents, including hydrogen atoms, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that intense femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser trigger rapid and complete Coulomb explosions of 2-iodopyridine and 2-iodopyrazine molecules. We obtain intriguingly clear momentum images depicting ten or eleven atoms, including all the hydrogens, and thus overcome a so-far impregnable barrier for complete Coulomb explosion imaging\textemdash its limitation on molecules consisting of three to five atoms. In combination with state-of-the-art multi-coincidence techniques and elaborate theoretical modelling, this allows tracing ultrafast hydrogen emission and obtaining information on the result of intramolecular electron rearrangement. Our work represents an important step towards imaging femtosecond chemistry via Coulomb explosion.},

  abstract = {There is widespread agreement about the need to assess the success of programs training scientists to communicate more effectively with non-professional audiences. However, there is little agreement about how that should be done. What do we mean when we talk about ``effective communication''? What should we measure? How should we measure it? Evaluation of communication training programs often incorporates the views of students or trainers themselves, although this is widely understood to bias the assessment. We recently completed a 3-year experiment to use audiences of nonscientists to evaluate the effect of training on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) graduate students' communication ability. Overall, audiences rated STEM grad students' communication performance no better after training than before, as we reported in Rubega et al. 2018. However, audience ratings do not reveal whether training changed specific trainee communication behaviors (e.g., jargon use, narrative techniques) even if too little to affect trainees' overall success. Here we measure trainee communication behavior directly, using multiple textual analysis tools and analysis of trainees' body language during videotaped talks. We found that student use of jargon declined after training but that use of narrative techniques did not increase. Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores, used as indicators of complexity of sentences and word choice, were no different after instruction. Trainees' movement of hands and hesitancy during talks was correlated negatively with audience ratings of credibility and clarity; smiling, on the other hand, was correlated with improvement in credibility, clarity and engagement scores given by audience members. We show that objective tools can be used to measure the success of communication training programs, that non-verbal cues are associated with audience judgments, and that an intensive communication course does change some, if not all, communication behaviors.},

On the one hand, it is claimed that it results in relativism of the worst sort since the political commitment to feminism is prima facie incompatible with scientific objectivity. On the other hand, when critics acknowledge that there may be some value in work that feminists have done, they comment that there is nothing particularly feminist about their accounts. I argue that both criticisms can be addressed through a better understanding of the current work in feminist epistemology. I offer an examination of standpoint theory as an illustration. Harding and Wylie have suggested ways in which the objectivity question can be addressed. These two accounts together with a third approach, `model-based objectivity', indicate there is a clear sense in which we can understand how a standpoint theory both contributes to a better understanding of scientific knowledge and can provide a feminist epistemology.},

Here, Nigel Cross takes up the arguments for a "third area" of education--design--that were outfined by Archer. He further defines this area by contrasting it with the other two--sciences and humanities--and goes on to consider the criteria which design must satisfy to be acceptable as a part of general education. Such an acceptance must imply a reorientation from the instrumental aims of conventional design education, towards intrinsic values. These values derive from the "designerly ways of knowing" Because of a common concern with these fundamental 'ways of knowing" both design research and design education are contributing to the development of design as a discipline.},

Results show that the typical science communication student is a woman with a career-orientated motivation pattern, mostly seeing science communication skills as an asset for a career in communication, science, or health. Be it career-driven, interest-driven, or online education-driven, motivation pattern differences emerge depending on the students' gender or field of study.

The rise of aperspectival history in nineteenth-century science is one strand of this plaited history of objectivity, as embodied in scientific ideals and practices. It is conceptually and historically distinct from the ontological aspect of objectivity that pursues the ultimate structure of reality, and from the mechanical aspect of objectivity that forbids interpretation in reporting and picturing scientific results. Whereas ontological objectivity is about the fit between theory and the world, and mechanical objectivity is about suppressing the universal human propensity to judge and aestheticize, aperspectival objectivity is about eliminating individual (or occasionally group) idiosyncracies. It emerged first in the moral and aesthetic philosophy of the late eighteenth century and spread to the natural sciences only in the mid-nineteenth century, as a result of a reorganization of scientific life that multiplied professional contacts at every level, from the international commission to the well-staffed laboratory.},

  abstract = {Laboratory transmission soft X-ray microscopy (L-TXM) has emerged as a complementary tool to synchrotron-based TXM and high-resolution biomedical 3D imaging in general in recent years. However, two major operational challenges in L-TXM still need to be addressed: a small field of view and a potentially misaligned rotation stage. As it is not possible to alter the magnification during operation, the field of view in L-TXM is usually limited to a few tens of micrometers. This complicates locating areas and objects of interest in the sample. Additionally, if the rotation axis of the sample stage cannot be adjusted prior to the experiments, an efficient workflow for tomographic imaging cannot be established, as refocusing and sample repositioning will become necessary after each recorded projection. Both these limitations have been overcome with the integration of a visible-light microscope (VLM) into the L-TXM system. Here, we describe the calibration procedure of the goniometer sample stage and the integrated VLM and present the resulting 3D imaging of a test sample. In addition, utilizing this newly integrated VLM, the extracellular matrix of cryofixed THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cells) was visualized by L-TXM for the first time in the context of an ongoing biomedical research project.},

We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations.

We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet 128\texttimes 128, 4.59 on ImageNet 256\texttimes 256, and 7.72 on ImageNet 512\texttimes 512, and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet 256\texttimes 256 and 3.85 on ImageNet 512\texttimes 512.

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to propose that in order to tackle the question of bias in algorithms, a systemic, sociotechnical and holistic perspective is needed. With reference to the term ``algorithmic culture,'' the interconnectedness and mutual shaping of society and technology are postulated. A sociotechnical approach requires translational work between and across disciplines. This conceptual paper undertakes such translational work. It exemplifies how gender and diversity studies, by bringing in expertise on addressing bias and structural inequalities, provide a crucial source for analyzing and mitigating bias in algorithmic systems. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} After introducing the sociotechnical context, an overview is provided regarding the contemporary discourse around bias in algorithms, debates around algorithmic culture, knowledge production and bias identification as well as common solutions. The key concepts of gender studies (situated knowledges and strong objectivity) and concrete examples of gender bias then serve as a backdrop for revisiting contemporary debates.},

By this means, Emmrich               et al.               found that individual copper and iron atoms formed toroidal structures on a copper surface. These shapes arise from the electrostatic attractions in the center of the atoms and Pauli repulsions at their edges. Individual atoms within clusters have underlying surface symmetry and can bind to different surface sites as clusters form.

Single copper and iron adatoms appeared as toroidal structures and multiatom clusters as connected structures, showing each individual atom as a torus. For single adatoms, the toroidal shape of the AFM image depends on the bonding symmetry of the adatom to the underlying structure [twofold for copper on copper(110) and threefold for iron on copper(111)]. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental data. The findings correct our previous work, in which multiple minima in the AFM signal were interpreted as a reflection of the orientation of a single front atom, and suggest that dual and triple minima in the force signal are caused by dimer and trimer tips, respectively.},

The information that needs to be communicated depends on the decisions that people face.

We examine these three classes of decisions in terms of how to characterize, assess, and convey the uncertainties relevant to each. We then offer a protocol for summarizing the many possible sources of uncertainty in standard terms, designed to impose a minimal burden on scientists, while gradually educating those whose decisions depend on their work. Its goals are better decisions, better science, and better support for science.},

TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices `appreciative theory' [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780\textendash 1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

We show that this process is influenced by the facial appearance of the scientist. We identify the traits that engender interest in a scientist's work and the perception that they do high-quality work, and show that these face-based impressions influence both the selection and evaluation of science news. These findings inform theories of person perception and illuminate a potential source of bias in the public's understanding of science.           ,              First impressions based on facial appearance predict many important social outcomes. We investigated whether such impressions also influence the communication of scientific findings to lay audiences, a process that shapes public beliefs, opinion, and policy. First, we investigated the traits that engender interest in a scientist's work, and those that create the impression of a ``good scientist'' who does high-quality research. Apparent competence and morality were positively related to both interest and quality judgments, whereas attractiveness boosted interest but decreased perceived quality. Next, we had members of the public choose real science news stories to read or watch and found that people were more likely to choose items that were paired with ``interesting-looking'' scientists, especially when selecting video-based communications. Finally, we had people read real science news items and found that the research was judged to be of higher quality when paired with researchers who look like ``good scientists.'' Our findings offer insights into the social psychology of science, and indicate a source of bias in the dissemination of scientific findings to broader society.},

The general goal of such studies is to understand cognition as it occurs in modern science. Attention is restricted to higher energy physics (HEP) practiced at a research laboratory such as the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN). The dominant paradigm in cognitive science would have us understand the acquisition of knowledge regarding elementary particles in terms of a cognitive agent that performs computations on a symbolic representation. In the case of HEP, however, it is difficult to identify a cognitive agent or the required symbolic representations and algorithms. The notion of `collective cognition' provides a step in the right direction, but does not go far enough. I argue that we need to invoke a more radical notion of `distributed cognition' that explicitly includes artefacts. However, the inclusion of artefacts in scientific cognitive systems makes application of the cognition as computation paradigm even more problematic. I conclude that scientific cognitive systems are hybrid systems including both computational and dynamical artefacts as well as human agents. Scientific knowledge itself is best regarded as the impersonal product of a whole scientific community.},

  abstract = {Analysis of tomographic datasets at synchrotron light sources (including X-ray transmission tomography, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and X-ray diffraction tomography) is becoming progressively more challenging due to the increasing data acquisition rates that new technologies in X-ray sources and detectors enable. The next generation of synchrotron facilities that are currently under design or construction throughout the world will provide diffraction-limited X-ray sources and are expected to boost the current data rates by several orders of magnitude, stressing the need for the development and integration of efficient analysis tools. Here an attempt to provide a collaborative framework for the analysis of synchrotron tomographic data that has the potential to unify the effort of different facilities and beamlines performing similar tasks is described in detail. The proposed Python-based framework is open-source, platform- and data-format-independent, has multiprocessing capability and supports procedural programming that many researchers prefer. This collaborative platform could affect all major synchrotron facilities where new effort is now dedicated to developing new tools that can be deployed at the facility for real-time processing, as well as distributed to users for off-site data processing.},

These visual representations act as the means for organizing the design to production process, hence serving as a "social glue" both between individuals and between groups. The author discusses two main capacities such visual representations serve in facilitating distributed cognition in team design work As conscription devices, they enlist and organize group participation. As boundary objects, they facilitate the reading of alternative meanings by various groups involved in the design process. The introduction of computer-aided design into this visual culture of engineering restructures relationships between workers in ways that can hamper the flexibility necessary for these crucial capacities to take place. The data are drawn from a study of the daily practices of engineers engaged in redesigning a turbine engine package. The method is participant observation.},

Greimas. From Latour's earliest texts in science studies onwards, semiotics has been a basic theoretical tool. As the article will show, Latour privileges the autonomy of language in order to avoid the ascription of substance to human and non-human actors. It is within this autonomous field that his general associology based on trials of strength can come into play. Furthermore, the article analyses Latour's theories concerning the gradual emergence of actors, circulation of references and technical mediation.Finally,the article tries to show how Latour's approach reaches a limit when it comes to the study of the settings of social action. A way out of this problem is sketched while at the same time remaining within a semiotic universe.},

This paper will focus on the role of imagery portraying science and scientists in Science et Vie and La Recherche, two French magazines. La Recherche uses more complex photographs, requiring more scientific knowledge from the reader, while Science et Vie uses more high-tech pictures. Both styles of picture originate from genuine scientific endeavours and have didactic aims. Science is then integrated into a system of familiar representations shown through stereotyped pictures (test tubes, etc.) revealing the process of science: the labs and their techniques rather than the results. However, La Recherche focuses more on portraying scientists as a group, especially recipients of honorary distinctions. The frequent use of `chalk and blackboard' is one way of dogmatizing scientific knowledge while pictures of scientists in their private lives is a way of popularizing and humanizing science. The scientist remains an archetype of knowledge \textemdash{} yet still as mortal as the layman. But science stays isolated from its economic or political context. In contrast to popular magazines, primary scientific journals never portray scientists, science being enunciated without reference to the enunciator, striving for absolute intellectualization.},

In order to foster learning, educators need to create an environment in which students can acquire the necessary knowledge exchange skills, innovation methods, and an entrepreneurial mindset.

  abstract = {Modeling and rendering of dynamic scenes is challenging, as natural scenes often contain complex phenomena such as thin structures, evolving topology, translucency, scattering, occlusion, and biological motion. Mesh-based reconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches (e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions, which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case in point.},

It is argued that the objects scientists actually work upon are highly artificial, in that their visibility depends upon complex instruments and careful preparatory procedures. Instruments and laboratory procedures do more than provide a window to the world; they lay the groundwork for specific analytic operations which utilize literary resources to represent phenomena graphically. Two specific cases from biology are discussed. The first is from a popular field manual, and is used to introduce themes for analyzing a more complex case, a neuroscience project using electron microscopy of brain tissue. The discussion of both cases concerns how specimens are modified into `docile objects' for purposes of investigation. These modifications are summarized under the headings of `marking', `constituting graphic space', and `normalizing observations'. Finally, it is claimed that these practices make up an `externalized retina' for scientific perception \textemdash{} a `retina' that depends upon disciplined conduct within the laboratory setting.},

This normative objective extends beyond particular TDR projects, as real-world problems are embedded in concrete contexts but, at the same time, are also related to wider societal challenges that are not restricted to one context. Therefore, TDR generally entails transfer of knowledge and results to other contexts. However, the TDR discourse has mainly treated transfer efforts from the perspective of scientific generalization, translation and packaging of knowledge. Within this understanding of transfer, little attention has been paid to interplay between contexts and the role of new contexts themselves.},

  abstract = {Imaging can be thought of as the most direct of experiments. You see something; you report what you see. If only things were truly this simple. Modern imaging technology has brought about a revolution in the kinds of questions we can approach, but this comes at the price of increasingly complex equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to market competing systems, the microscopes have often been inappropriately described as easy to use and suitable for near-beginners. Insufficient understanding of the experimental manipulations and equipment set-up leads to the introduction of errors during image acquisition. In this feature, I review some of the most common practical pitfalls faced by researchers during image acquisition, and how they can affect the interpretation of the experimental data.             This article is targeted neither to the microscopy gurus who push forward the frontiers of imaging technology nor to my imaging specialist colleagues who may wince at the overly simplistic comments and lack of detail. Instead, this is for beginners who gulp with alarm when they hear the word ``confocal pinhole'' or sigh as they watch their cells fade and die in front of their very eyes time and time again at the microscope. Take heart, beginners, if microscopes were actually so simple then many people (including myself) would suddenly be out of a job!},

The immobilization of cobalt catalysts with dispersed subnanometer particles in mesoporous N-doped carbon matrixes is also shown. These materials were used as catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes under considerably mild conditions. The surface area and the presence of nitrogen on the supports were demonstrated to be fundamental to disperse and stabilize the active metal species, which were responsible for the outstanding performance of these materials compared to cobalt catalysts deposited on silica, alumina, or mesoporous carbon. Finally, the ability to catalyze the hydrogenation of nitroarenes containing electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) with good selectivity was also explored.},

Hydrological education that was traditionally teacher centred, where the students look up to the teacher for expertise and information, should change to better prepare hydrologists to develop new knowledge and apply it in new contexts. An important first step towards this goal is to change the concept of education in the educators' minds. The results of an investigation to find out whether didactic training influences the beliefs of hydrology educators about their teaching styles is presented. Faculty of UNESCO-IHE has been offered a didactic certification program named university teaching qualification (UTQ). The hypothesis that UTQ training will significantly alter the teaching style of faculty at UNESCO-IHE from expert/formal authority traits towards facilitator/delegator traits was tested. A first survey was conducted among the entire teaching staff (total 101, response rate 58 \%). The results indicated that there are significantly higher traits of facilitator and delegator teaching styles among UTQ graduates compared to faculty who were not significantly trained in didactics. The second survey which was conducted among UTQ graduates (total 20, response rate 70 \%), enquiring after their teaching styles before and after UTQ, corroborated these findings.},

In this paper, the integration of two software toolboxes, TomoPy and the ASTRA toolbox, which, together, provide a powerful framework for processing tomographic data, is presented. The integration combines the advantages of both toolboxes, such as the user-friendliness and CPU-efficient methods of TomoPy and the flexibility and optimized GPU-based reconstruction methods of the ASTRA toolbox. It is shown that both toolboxes can be easily installed and used together, requiring only minor changes to existing TomoPy scripts. Furthermore, it is shown that the efficient GPU-based reconstruction methods of the ASTRA toolbox can significantly decrease the time needed to reconstruct large datasets, and that advanced reconstruction methods can improve reconstruction quality compared with TomoPy's standard reconstruction method.},

This leads to the possibility of analysing the structure at a very fine level of detail: one can refine multiple conformations, measure the deviations from the standard stereochemistry, visualize hydrogen atoms and determine the protonation states of catalytic residues of enzymes. In many cases, this information is directly related to the function of proteins. In this review, the methodological improvements are described, brief information about all the structures solved at resolution better than 0.85 \AA{} is given, with particular emphasis on the additional information given by subatomic resolution, and some examples are treated in detail. The availability of crystallographic data at this resolution opens wide perspectives for theoretical modelling. Among them the most promising are the approaches (mostly under development) to determine the reactivity directly from the diffraction data.},

XAFS is a very versatile method that is usually divided into two sub methods: extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopies, which need different experimental conditions concerning spectral resolving power, energetic bandwidth and number of detected photons. For facilitating XANES and EXAFS spectroscopies with laboratory- and von Hamos-based spectrometers, tailored optics were designed as well as optimized spectrometer components,               i.e.               an adequate microfocus X-ray source and a pixelated detector, were chosen. This is shown with a demonstration experiment on pure copper foil. In the XANES case a spectral resolving power of               E               /{$\Delta$}               E               {$\approx$} 4000 and an energy bandpass of around 300 eV were achieved with a measurement time of               t               = 7 min. For EXAFS, the tailored optic has an increased solid angle at moderate spectral resolving power in combination with a large energy bandpass of over 1 keV and a measurement time of               t               = 250 s for the given copper foil. These optimized solutions pave the way to perform XANES and EXAFS in the laboratory even for diluted samples with analyte concentrations of only a few weight percent or even less in a reasonable time frame of minutes to hours. Spectrometers, that already had an impact on research, especially catalysis research, therefore, made a huge leap in efficiency that prepares them to meet new challenges, not only as a standalone method, but also in combination with high-end synchrotron radiation facility-based XAFS experiments.},

This article uses bibliometric and webometric techniques to gather data on the characteristics of TED presenters and videos and analyze the relationship between these characteristics and the subsequent impact of the videos. The results show that the presenters were predominately male and non-academics. Male-authored videos were more popular and more liked when viewed on YouTube. Videos by academic presenters were more commented on than videos by others and were more liked on YouTube, although there was little difference in how frequently they were viewed. The majority of academic presenters were senior faculty, males, from United States-based institutions, were visible online, and were cited more frequently than average for their field. However, giving a TED presentation appeared to have no impact on the number of citations subsequently received by an academic, suggesting that although TED popularizes research, it may not promote the work of scientists within the academic community.},

  abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a light-emitting protein that does not require a prosthetic group for its fluorescent activity. As such, GFP has become indispensable as a molecular tool in molecular biology. Nonetheless, there has been no subatomic elucidation of the GFP structure owing to the structural polymorphism around the chromophore. Here, subatomic resolution X-ray structures of GFP without the structural polymorphism are reported. The positions of H atoms, hydrogen-bonding network patterns and accurate geometric parameters were determined for the two protonated forms. Compared with previously determined crystal structures and theoretically optimized structures, the anionic chromophores of the structures represent the authentic resonance state of GFP. In addition, charge-density analysis based on atoms-in-molecules theory and noncovalent interaction analysis highlight weak but substantial interactions between the chromophore and the protein environment. Considered with the derived chemical indicators, the lone pair\textendash{$\pi$} interactions between the chromophore and Thr62 should play a sufficient role in maintaining the electronic state of the chromophore. These results not only reveal the fine structural features that are critical to understanding the properties of GFP, but also highlight the limitations of current quantum-chemical calculations.},

But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarizes current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty\textemdash facts, numbers and science\textemdash and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.},

I see my voyage as an exercise in applied hope, resisting the constraints that disciplines and academia try to place on scholars and helping others to do so as well, by both example and institution-building.},

However, in this study, we found one of the most attractive tools to discriminate a specific atom from the others even in the difficult Si\textendash Ge system. Ge atoms are shown as dim spots in comparison to Si atoms with bright spots on the intermixed surface by a weak chemical bonding energy and/or a relaxation effect despite large atomic radius and high spatial position in both variable frequency shift and topographic images. The discrimination of individual atoms with respect to the chemical interaction variation will further provide a chance to manipulate different atomic species and assemble various nanostructures in near future.},

The antibody binds to an epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that is distinct from the receptor-binding site. CR3022 likely binds more tightly to SARS-CoV because its epitope contains a glycan not present in SARS-CoV-2. Structural modeling showed that the epitope is only revealed when at least two of the three spike proteins are in a conformation competent to bind the receptor.                                         Science               , this issue p.               630                        ,              Structural studies show that a SARS antibody binds a conserved epitope on the viral spike distinct from the receptor-binding site.           ,              The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome\textendash coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic, but there is currently very little understanding of the antigenicity of the virus. We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein at 3.1-angstrom resolution. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding epitope can only be accessed by CR3022 when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the ``up'' conformation and slightly rotated. These results provide molecular insights into antibody recognition of SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the scientific literature available on the types of general competences and their classification caused the authors to conclude that it is necessary to implement interdisciplinary approach in engineering education to develop competences necessary for engineers to make them competitive in the labour market. The attention should be paid to a professional foreign language, computer literacy and educational psychology recommendations. To improve professional foreign language skills, CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) method should be integrated in the study process of engineering education. In order to develop information literacy competence, it is important to create a single e-study environment. The academic staff, developing study subjects for engineering programmes, should focus on the study content and study methods. As regards the content, the compromise should be sought between fundamental acquisition of the knowledge of the subject matter, the know-how of the application of this knowledge as well as the use of brand new software in the calculations. The paper presents the examples of the application of the interdisciplinary approach in the universities, where the authors of the paper are affiliated: the LUA (Latvia University of Agriculture) and the RTU (Riga Technical University), respectively.},

  abstract = {Targeting a key enzyme in SARS-CoV-2                            Scientists across the world are working to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome\textendash coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Zhang               et al.               determined the x-ray crystal structure of a key protein in the virus' life cycle: the main protease. This enzyme cuts the polyproteins translated from viral RNA to yield functional viral proteins. The authors also developed a lead compound into a potent inhibitor and obtained a structure with the inhibitor bound, work that may provide a basis for development of anticoronaviral drugs.

An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (M               pro               , also called 3CL               pro               ) because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the x-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M               pro               and its complex with an {$\alpha$}-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. On the basis of the unliganded structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 M               pro               . The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.},

  abstract = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of interest for many applications originating from their mechanically robust architectures, low density, and high accessible surface area. Depending on their linkers and binding patterns, COFs mainly exhibit microporosity, even though COFs with small mesopores have been reported using extended linkers. For some applications, especially when fast mass transport is desired, hierarchical pore structures are an ideal solution, e.g., with small micropores providing large surface areas and larger macropores providing unhindered transport to and from the materials surface. Herein, we have developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of crystalline COFs with inherent microporosity and template-induced, homogeneously distributed, yet tunable, macroporous structures. This method has been successfully applied to obtain various {$\beta$}ketoenamine-based COFs with interconnected macro-microporous structures. The as-synthesized macroporous COFs preserve high crystallinity with high specific surface area. When bipyridine moieties are introduced into the COF backbone, metals such as Co2+ can be coordinated within the hierarchical pore structure (macro-TpBpy-Co). The resulting macro-TpBpyCo exhibits a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which is much improved compared to the purely microporous COF with a competitive overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA/cm2. This can be attributed to the improved mass diffusion properties in the hierarchically porous COF structures, together with the easily accessible active Co2+-bipyridine sites.},
