## *Judgement against Objectivity* by Peter Galison
{% cite galison1998a %}

For Galison "Objectivity is a fighting word". 
He argues that over the last centuries the function and ideal of scientific images were changing.

In the pre-nineteenth century, scientsts depicted the "hidden true picture", which involved artistic intervention. 
The ambition was to attain pictoral "truth to nature". The result was the *metphysical image*.
In the 19th century photography led to the *mechnical image*. Science tried to let nature "speak for itself".
The last stage is the *interpreted image* emerging in the 20th century. Galison the trained eye of the expert needed to recognize patterns in the images and therefore subjective judgement becomes part of the "objective" scientific process.
