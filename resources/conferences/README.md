### [Robert Schnüll](https://rfws.de/) Open Sourcing a University

RS is part of the [.medienhaus\\](https://medienhaus.udk-berlin.de/)

"As the COVID-19 pandemic happened, we quickly needed to provide an intuitive remote collaboration platform, satisfying the requirements and needs of an art school during this crisis and beyond. We rapidly prototyped and iteratively enhanced a privacy-focused, free and open-source set of tools and services for our students and staff."

Web1 was more decentralized than Web2. Do we need the new Web3 or would it be better to "go back" to Web1?

### [Claude Draude](https://www.uni-kassel.de/forschung/iteg/startseite/organisation/direktorium/prof-dr-phil-claude-draude) Reconfiguring Participation and Power Relations in Sociotechnical Systems Design

"Claude Draude is professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kassel, Germany. She works with approaches from intersectional feminist STS, new materialism, arts and design in computing."

She is researching Sociotechnical Systems Design, taking into account the multitude of biases and suppressions in information systems.
Bias can be rooted in the data, the algorithms & models, as well as in the use of systems.

C. Draude integrates concepts from feminist scientists like Donna Haraway and Karen Barad.
She was talking about the concept of diffraction as Barad uses it. **New Materialism** in SSD
