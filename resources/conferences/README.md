She is researching Sociotechnical Systems Design, taking into account the multitude of biases and suppressions in information systems.
Bias can be rooted in the data, the algorithms & models, as well as in the use of systems.

C. Draude integrates concepts from feminist scientists like Donna Haraway and Karen Barad.
She was talking about the concept of diffraction as Barad uses it. **New Materialism** in SSD
